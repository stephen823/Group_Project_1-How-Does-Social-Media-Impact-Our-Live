# Best_Team_Project_1
Social media had become an integral part of our daily life have a significant impact on behaviours. However, in what way did social media impacted our everyday life and are there noticeable patterns of these impacts?  Based on data from a survey of 292 people, we will answer four questions in this group project. Firstly, which social media platforms do people spend most of their time on? Secondly, how does the length of social media time impact people’s physical activity time? Thirdly, does length time spend on social media impact people’s exposure to cyber-crime? And finally, what role does preference on communication type play in people’s allocation of time to social media?
